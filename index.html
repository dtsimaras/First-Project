    <h2> Requirements </h2>
    <p>
      In order to be eligible to get your mythic weapon, you must meet ALL of
      these requirements:
    <ol>
      <li>
        You must have completed Twine Peak Storm Shield
        Defense 5. If you need help with your Storm Shield Defense (SSD), check
        out my SSD carry listing.
      </li>
      <li>
        You must have the Storm King Quest in your
        Quests Log (For the first time, it appears as King Me Quest), and if
        it's not your first time, it will appear in Weekly Challenges.
      </li>
      <li>
        You must
        have completed your Prequest (the quests are in 140+ zones). If you
        haven't completed your Prequest, purchase the bundle Prequest+MSK (it
        shows as MPN in the listing)
      </li>
      <p>
        If all 3 above are done, you must make sure again you have the Quest that says:
        Eliminate/Defeat The Mythic Storm King (Be careful! It resets every week).
      </p>

    </ol>
